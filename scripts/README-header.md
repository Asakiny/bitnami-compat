## What is Bitnami-Compat?

* This repository builds multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) docker images for a selection of the Bitnami repositories.

* This is a workaround for https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/7305.

* These images are NOT intended for production use.

  * I don't have time to test every images and I haven't built the infrastructure to test them.
  * In other words, this repository has no release management process and no support for it.
  * This repository is mainly maintained for use on my Raspberry Pi cluster.

* These images use Bitnami's scripts. Binaries refer to the official Docker or official distribution binaries of the software or Docker recipes for Docker.
