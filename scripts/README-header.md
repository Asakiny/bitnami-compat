# bitnami-compat
## What is Bitnami-Compat?
This repository builds multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) docker images for a selection of the Bitnami repositories.
This is a workaround for https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/7305.

These images are NOT intended for production use.

These images use Bitnami's scripts. Binaries refer to the official Docker or official distribution binaries of the software or Docker recipes for Docker.
